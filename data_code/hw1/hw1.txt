Search Engine: Bing
Average Percent Overlap: 23.5
Average Spearman Coefficient: -7.46486

As we can see from the stats above, Bing did not perform well compared to Google.
Google and Bing searching results do not have much overlapping results. Only around average 23.5% are the same. 
This means that Bing disagrees with Google much more than it agrees with Google. 
Besides, it has a negative average spearman coefficient which is -7.46486. 
Thus, it indicates that Bing has a different way of ranking results of queries and a different decision-making thought about the relevance between URLs compared to Google.
